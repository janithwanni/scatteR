Description: Generate bivariate data based on scatterplot features defined through scagnostics. Scagnostics is an exploratory graphical tool that defines nine features of a scatterplot based on the characteristics of three geometric graphs defined on the scatterplot. The exact calculation of these measurements are based on Wilkinson, L., Anand, A., & Grossman, R. (2005) <doi:10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532142>. 
    Set the required values for the scagnostic measurement type and the number of points that are needed to generate a bivariate dataset that gives the expected scagnostic measurements.
